The gravity room has a control panel that alters the gravity of all objects in the room, except the player. The panel has five buttons, four buttons for directions and one for zero gravity. Behind the control panel you can find a puzzle. This puzzle is solved by using the gravity buttons and interacting with the valve. You also need to first move a green cylinder blocking an entrance in the pipe. This is also done by altering gravity direction. The room is also filled with small items that will whirl around as the player shifts the gravity.

The gear room is primarily filled with a gear puzzle divided up in two parts on either side. The task is to place gears from one starter gear towards an end gear so that it meshes together into a chain to move. To do this, there are three different gear types found in the room with each having different turning resistances which needs to be taken into consideration. If a certain power threshold is surpassed the gears will stop since the recistandce will be to high from the gears. When the gear puzzle is solved, a golden gear is given to the player to help solve the real world puzzle.
